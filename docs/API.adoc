[[API]]
== The Tamaya API
=== Overview
Though Tamaya is a very powerful and flexible solution there are basically only a few simple core concepts required
that build the base of all the other mechanisms:

The API provides these artifacts, which are:

* A simple but complete SE *API* for accessing key/value based _Configuration_:
  ** +Configuration+ hereby models configuration, the main interface of Tamaya. +Configuration+ provides
     *** access to literal key/value pairs.
     *** functional extension points (+with,query+) based on +UnaryOperator<Configuration>+ (operator) and
         +Function<Configuration,T>+ (query).
  ** +ConfigurationProvider+ provides the static entry point for accessing configuration.
  ** +ConfigProvider+ provides static access to the current +Configuration+ (default configuration)
  ** +ConfigException+ defines a runtime exception for usage by the configuration system.
  ** +TypeLiteral+ provides a possibility to type safe define the target type to be returned by a registered
     +PropertyProvider+.
  ** +PropertyConverter+, which defines conversion of String values into any required target types.

* Additionally the *SPI* provides:
  ** _PropertySource:_ is the the SPI for adding configuration data. A +PropertySource+
     hereby
     *** is designed as a minimalistic data interface to be implemented by any kind of data providers (local or remote)
     *** provides data key/value pairs in raw format as String key/values only
     *** can optionally support scanning of its provided values
  ** _PropertySourceProvider:_ allows to add property sources dynamically.
  ** +ConfigurationProviderSpi+ defines the SPI that is used as a backing bean for the +ConfigurationProvider+
     singleton.
  ** +PropertyFilter+, which allows filtering of property values prior getting returned to the caller.
  ** +ConfigurationContext+, which provides the container that contains the property sources and filters that form a
     configuration.
  ** +PropertyValueCombinationPolicy+ optionally can be registered to change the way how different key/value
     pairs are combined to build up the final +Configuration+ passed over to the filters registered.
  ** +ServiceContext+, which provides access to the components loaded, depending on the current runtime stack.
  ** +ServiceContextManager+ provides static access to the +ServiceContext+ loaded.

This is also reflected in the main parts of the API, which is quite small:

* +org.apache.tamaya+ contains the main API abstractions used by users.
* +org.apache.tamaya.spi+ contains the SPI interfaces to be implemented by implementations and the +ServiceContext+
  mechanism.


=== How Tamaya organizes Configuration

All the mentioned artifacts are used to organize configuration in a higly flexible and extendable way. Hereby the
+PropertySource+ is the key artifact. In general Tamaya organizes Configuration as follows:

. Bootstrapping
  ** Initially the JDK +ServiceLoader+ API is used to determine a +ServiceContext+ implementation that should control
     Tamaya overall component loading. If not found, a default implementation is registered, which relies on the
     Java +ServiceLoader+ mechanism. In all other cases the found instance is registered to resolve any loading of
     components and services within Tamaya.

. Loading and building the current +ConfigurationContext+:
  ** Tamaya loads all available +PropertySource+ instances. Hereby +PropertySource+ instances can be
    *** Directly registered (using the mechanism defined by the current +ServiceContext+ implementation, by default
        the Java +ServiceLoader+.
    *** Provided by a registered instance of +PropertySourceProvider+.
  ** All loaded property sources are _ordered based on each ordinal_, returned from +PropertySource.getOrdinal()+ as
    an ordered chain of PropertySources, building up the ordered chain of +PropertySource+ instances used for raw
    configuration value evaluation.
  ** Tamaya loads all available +PropertyFilter+ instances. Hereby +PropertyFilter+ instances can be registered
     by default using the Java +ServiceLoader+ API. The +PropertyFilter+ instances loaded are ordered based on the
     +@Priority+ annotations found on each filter. If no priority annotation is present, +0+ is assumed.
  ** Tamaya loads all available +PropertyConverter+ instances. Hereby +PropertyConverter+ instances can be registered
       by default using the Java +ServiceLoader+ API. The +PropertyConverter+ instances loaded are ordered based on the
       +@Priority+ annotations found on each filter. If no priority annotation is present, +0+ is assumed. It is
       possible to register multiple converters for the same target type.

. Evaluating raw property values:
  ** When evaluating a concrete configuration value for a given key, Tamaya iterates through this chain of registered
     PropertySources. Hereby the final value, by default, is determined by the last non-null value returned from a
     +PropertySource+.
  ** Since the ladder may not always be appropriate, e.g. when values should be combined instead of overridden, a
     instance of +PropertyValueCombinationPolicy+ can be registered, which allows to add more detailed behaviour how values
     are combined.
  ** Access to the complete configuration +Map+ is performing the same resolution and combination algorithm, but for all
     key/value pairs available.

. Filtering the raw properties:
  ** Each raw configuration value evaluated is filtered by the ordered filter chain, as long as there are any changes
     applied by any of the filters called. This ensures that also transitive replacements by filters are possible.
     If, after a configurable number of evaluation loops still values are changes during each loop, the filtering
     process is aborted, since a non-resolvable circular filter issue is assumed.
  ** The ourput is the final configuration value as type +String+.

. Applying further conversions:
  ** Finally, if the required target type, does not match +Java.lang.String+, all registered +PropertyConverter+
     instances targeting the corresponding target type are asked to convert the given final String-based configuration
     entry to the required target type.
  ** The first non-null value returned by a +PropertyConverter+ is used as the final typed configuration value and
     returned to the caller.

. Adding/Changing functionality:
  ** Basically the bahaviour of Tamaya can be customized using the following mechanisms:
     *** Registering additional (default) +PropertySource+ instances.
     *** Registering additional (default) +PropertySourceProvider+ instances.
     *** Adapting the way how multiple entries with the same key are combined (+PropertyValueCombinationPolicy+).
     *** Adding additional support for new target types configurable by registering additional +PropertyConverter+
         instances.
     *** Complex extensions may adapt the complete +ConfigurationContext+, using the +ConfigurationContextBuilder+ and
         reapply the changed instance using +ConfigurationProvider.setConfigurationContext(ConfigurationContext)+.
         This is one example how to react on dynamic changes detected on configuration files read.
     *** Registering additional +PropertyFilter+ instances, that filter the configuration values extracted.
     *** Registering an alternate +ServiceContext+ to support alternate runtime containers, e.g. a CDI container.
     *** A combination of all above.
  ** Additionally instances of +ConfigOperator, ConfigQuery+ can be provided that provide additional functionality
     that should not be globally visible. It is recommended to provide them from a singleton accessor, hereby hiding
     the effective implementation classes.

=== Compatibility

The Tamaya API basically is compatible with Java 7 and Java 8. Java 8 additionally introduces additional methods
hereby leveraging the newly added Java 8 +Optional+ features and _default_ methods.


[[APIKeyValues]]
=== Key/Value Pairs

Basically configuration is a very generic concept. Therefore it should be modelled in a generic way. The most simple
and most commonly used approach are simple literal key/value pairs. So the core building block of {name} are key/value pairs.
You can think of a common +.properties+ file, e.g.

[source,properties]
.A simple properties file
--------------------------------------------
a.b.c=cVal
a.b.c.1=cVal1
a.b.c.2=cVal2
a=aVal
a.b=abVal
a.b2=abVal
--------------------------------------------

Now you can use +java.util.Properties+ to read this file and access the corresponding properties, e.g.

[source,properties]
--------------------------------------------
Properties props = new Properties();
props.readProperties(...);
String val = props.getProperty("a.b.c");
val = props.getProperty("a.b.c.1");
...
--------------------------------------------


==== Why Using Strings Only

There are good reason to keep of non String-values as core storage representation of configuration. Mostly
there are several huge advantages:

* Strings are simple to understand
* Strings are human readable and therefore easy to prove for correctness
* Strings can easily be used within different language, different VMs, files or network communications.
* Strings can easily be compared and manipulated
* Strings can easily be searched, indexed and cached
* It is very easy to provide Strings as configuration, which gives much flexibility for providing configuration in
  production as well in testing.
* and more...

On the other side there are also disadvantages:

* Strings are inherently not type safe, they do not provide validation out of the box for special types, such as
numbers, dates etc.
* In many cases you want to access configuration in a typesafe way avoiding conversion to the target types explicitly
  throughout your code.
* Strings are neither hierarchical nor multi-valued, so mapping hierarchical and collection structures requires some
  extra efforts.

Nevertheless most of these advantages can be mitigated easily, hereby still keeping all the benefits from above:

* Adding type safe adapters on top of String allow to add any type easily, that can be directly mapped out of Strings.
  This includes all common base types such as numbers, dates, time, but also timezones, formatting patterns and more.
* Also multi-valued, complex and collection types can be defined as a corresponding +PropertyAdapter+ knows how to
  parse and create the target instance required.
* String s also can be used as references pointing to other locations and formats, where configuration is
  accessible.


[[API Configuration]]
=== Configuration

+Configuration+ is the main API provided by Tamaya. It allows reading of single property values or the whole
property map, but also supports type safe access.


==== Configuration (Java 7)

The minimal API defined for Java version earlier than Java 8 looks as follows:

[source,java]
.Interface Configuration in Java 7
--------------------------------------------
public interface Configuration{
    String get(String key);
    <T> T get(String key, Class<T> type);
    <T> T get(String key, TypeLiteral<T> type);
    Map<String,String> getProperties();

    // extension points
    Configuration with(ConfigOperator operator);
    <T> T query(ConfigQuery<T> query);
}
--------------------------------------------

Hereby

* +<T> T get(String, Class<T>)+ provides type safe accessors for all basic wrapper types of the JDK.
* +with, query+ provide the extension points for adding additional functionality.
* +getProperties()+ provides access to all key/values, whereas entries from non scannable property sources may not
  be included.

The class +TypeLiteral+ is basically similar to the same class provided with CDI:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------
public class TypeLiteral<T> implements Serializable {

    [...]

    protected TypeLiteral(Type type) {
        this.type = type;
    }

    protected TypeLiteral() { }

    public static <L> TypeLiteral<L> of(Type type){...}
    public static <L> TypeLiteral<L> of(Class<L> type){...}

    public final Type getType() {...}
    public final Class<T> getRawType() {...}

    public static Type getGenericInterfaceTypeParameter(Class<?> clazz, Class<?> interfaceType){...}
    public static Type getTypeParameter(Class<?> clazz, Class<?> interfaceType){...}

    [...]
}
--------------------------------------------

Instances of +Configuration+ can be accessed from the +ConfigurationProvider+ singleton:

[source,java]
.Accessing Configuration
--------------------------------------------
Configuration config = ConfigurationProvider.getConfiguration();
--------------------------------------------

Hereby the singleton is backed up by an instance of +ConfigurationProviderSpi+.

==== Configuration (Java 8)

The API for Java 8 adds additional support for +Optional+:

[source,java]
.Interface Configuration in Java 8
--------------------------------------------
public interface Configuration{
    // methods also defined in Java 7
    String get(String key);
    <T> T get(String key, Class<T> type);
    <T> T get(String key, TypeLiteral<T> type);
    Map<String,String> getProperties();
    Configuration with(ConfigOperator operator);
    <T> T query(ConfigQuery<T> query);

    // new java 8 optional support
    default Optional<String> getOptional(String key){...}
    default <T> Optional<T> getOptional(String key, Class<T> type){...}
    default <T> Optional<T> getOptional(String key, TypeLiteral<T> type){...}

    default Boolean getBoolean(String key){...}
    default OptionalInt getInteger(String key){...}
    default OptionalLong getLong(String key){...}
    default OptionalDouble getDouble(String key){...}
}
--------------------------------------------

Hereby

* +get(String)+ and +getOptional(String)+ provide easy access to any kind of configuration properties in their
  String format.
* +get(String, TypeLiteral)+, +getOptional(String, TypeLiteral)+, +get(String, Class)+ and
  +getOptional(String, Class)+ provide type safe access to configuration properties.
  +PropertyConverter+ instances can be registered for a given
  target type. The are managed in an ordered list, whereas the ordering is defined by +@Priority+ annotations
  on the converters.
* +getProperties()+ gives access to all known (=scannable) properties.
* +with, query+ provide the extension points for adding additional functionality modelled by +ConfigOperator,
  ConfigQuery+.

Instances of +Configuration+ can be accessed, exactly like in Java 7, from the +ConfigurationProvider+ singleton:

[source,java]
.Accessing Configuration
--------------------------------------------
Configuration config = ConfigurationProvider.getConfiguration();
--------------------------------------------

Hereby the +ConfigurationProvider+ singleton is backed up by an instance of +<<ConfigurationProviderSpi>>+.


[[PropertyConverter]]
==== Property Converters

As illustrated in the previous section, +Configuration+ also to access non String types. Nevertheless internally
all properties are strictly modelled as pure Strings only, so non String types must be derived by converting the
configured String values into the required target type. This is achieved with the help of +PropertyConverters+:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------
public interface PropertyConverter<T>{
    T convert(String value);
    //X TODO Collection<String> getSupportedFormats();
}
--------------------------------------------

+PropertyConverter+ instances can be implemented and registered by default using the +ServiceLoader+. Hereby
a configuration String value is passed to all registered converters for a type in order of their annotated +@Priority+
value. The first non-null result of a converter is then returned as the current configuration value.

Access to converters is provided by the current +ConfigurationContext+, which is accessible from
the +ConfigurationProvider+ singleton.


[[ExtensionPoints]]
=== Extension Points

We are well aware of the fact that this library will not be able to cover all kinds of use cases. Therefore
we have added functional extension mechanisms to +Configuration+ that were used in other areas of the Java eco-system
as well:

* +with(ConfigOperator operator)+ allows to pass arbitrary unary functions that take and return instances of
  +Configuration+. Operators can be used to cover use cases such as filtering, configuration views, security
  interception and more.
* +query(ConfigQuery query)+ allows to apply a function returning any kind of result based on a
  +Configuration+ instance. Queries are used for accessing/deriving any kind of data based on of a +Configuration+
  instance, e.g. accessing a +Set<String>+ of root keys present.

Both interfaces hereby are functional interfaces. Because of backward compatibility with Java 7 we did not use
+UnaryOperator+ and +Function+ from the +java.util.function+ package. Nevertheless usage is similar, so you can
use Lambdas and method references in Java 8:

[source,java]
.Applying a +ConfigurationQuery+ using a method reference
--------------------------------------------
ConfigSecurity securityContext = Configuration.current().query(ConfigSecurity::targetSecurityContext);
--------------------------------------------

NOTE: +ConfigSecurity+ is an arbitrary class only for demonstration purposes.


Operator calls basically look similar:

[source,java]
.Applying a +ConfigurationOperator+ using a lambda expression:
--------------------------------------------
Configuration secured = ConfigurationProvider.getConfiguration()
                           .with((config) ->
                                 config.getOptional("foo").isPresent()?;
                                 FooFilter.apply(config):
                                 config);
--------------------------------------------


[[ConfigException]]
=== ConfigException

The class +ConfigException+ models the base *runtime* exception used by the configuration system.


[[SPI]]
== SPI

[[PropertySource]]
=== Interface PropertySource

We have seen that constraining configuration aspects to simple literal key/value pairs provides us with an easy to
understand, generic, flexible, yet expendable mechanism. Looking at the Java language features a +java.util.Map<String,
String>+ and +java.util.Properties+ basically model these aspects out of the box.

Though there are advantages in using these types as a model, there are some severe drawbacks, notably implementation
of these types is far not trivial and the collection API offers additional functionality not useful when aiming
for modelling simple property sources.

To render an implementation of a custom +PropertySource+ as convenient as possible only the following methods were
identified to be necessary:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------
public interface PropertySource{
      int getOrdinal();
      String getName();
      String get(String key);
      boolean isScannable();
      Map<String, String> getProperties();
}
--------------------------------------------

Hereby

* +get+ looks similar to the methods on +Map+. It may return +null+ in case no such entry is available.
* +getProperties+ allows to extract all property data to a +Map<String,String>+. Other methods like +containsKey,
  keySet+ as well as streaming operations then can be applied on the returned +Map+ instance.
* But not in all scenarios a property source may be scannable, e.g. when looking up keys is very inefficient, it
  may not make sense to iterator over all keys to collect the corresponding properties.
  This can be evaluated by calling +isScannable()+. If a +PropertySource+ is defined as non scannable accesses to
  +getProperties()+ may not return all key/value pairs that would be available when accessed directly using the
  +String get(String)+ method.
* +getOrdinal()+ defines the ordinal of the +PropertySource+. Property sources are managed in an ordered chain, where
  property sources with higher ordinals override the ones with lower ordinals. If ordinal are the same, the natural
  ordering of the fulloy qualified class names of the property source implementations are used. The reason for
  not using +@Priority+ annotations is that property sources can define dynamically their ordinals, e.g. based on
  a property contained with the configuration itself.
* Finally +getName()+ returns a (unique) name that identifies the +PropertySource+ within the current
  +ConfigurationContext+.

This interface can be implemented by any kind of logic. It could be a simple in memory map, a distributed configuration
provided by a data grid, a database, the JNDI tree or other resources. Or it can be a combination of multiple
property sources with additional combination/aggregation rules in place.

+PropertySources+ are by default registered using the Java +ServiceLoader+ or the mechanism provided by the current
 active +ServiceContext+.


[[PropertySourceProvider]]
==== Interface PropertySourceProvider

Instances of this type can be used to register multiple instances of +PropertySource+.

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------
// @FunctionalInterface in Java 8
public interface PropertySourceProvider{
    Collection<PropertySource> getPropertySources();
}
--------------------------------------------

This allows to evaluate the property sources to be read/that are available dynamically. All property sources
are read out and added to the current chain of +PropertySource+ instances within the current +ConfigurationContext+,
refer also to [[ConfigurationContext]].

+PropertySourceProviders+ are by default registered using the Java +ServiceLoader+ or the mechanism provided by the
current active +ServiceContext+.


[[PropertyFilter]]
==== Interface PropertyFilter

Also +PropertyFilters+ can be added to a +Configuration+. They are evaluated before a +Configuration+ instance is
passed to the user. Filters can hereby used for multiple purposes, such as

* resolving placeholders
* masking sensitive entries, such as passwords
* constraining visibility based on the current active user
* ...

+PropertyFilters+ are by default registered using the Java +ServiceLoader+ or the mechanism provided by the current
active +ServiceContext+. Similar to property sources they are managed in an ordered filter chain, based on the
applied +@Priority+ annotations.

A +PropertyFilter+ is defined as follows:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------
// @FunctionalInterface in Java 8
public interface PropertyConverter{
    String filterProperty(String key, String valueToBeFiltered);
}
--------------------------------------------

Hereby:

* returning +null+ will remove the key from the final result
* non null values are used as the current value of the key. Nevertheless for resolving multi-step dependencies
  filter evaluation has to be continued as long as filters are still changing some of the values to be returned.
  To prevent possible endless loops after a defined number of loops evaluation is stopped.

This method is called each time a single entry is accessed, and for each property in a full properties result.


[[PropertyValueCombinationPolicy]]
==== Interface PropertyValueCombinationPolicy

This interface can be implemented optional. It can be used to adapt the way how property key/value pairs are combined to
build up the final Configuration to be passed over to the +PropertyFilters+. The default implementation is just
overriding all values read before with the new value read. Nevertheless for collections and other use cases it is
often useful to have alternate combination policies in place, e.g. for combining values from previous sources with the
new value.

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------
@FunctionalInterface
public interface PropertyValueCombinationPolicy{

   public final PropertyValueCombinationPolicy DEFAULT_OVERRIDING_COLLECTOR =
           (current, key, propertySource) -> Optional.ofNullable(propertySource.get(key))
                                                     .filter(s -> !s.isEmpty())
                                                     .orElse(current);

   String collect(String currentValue, String key, PropertySource propertySource);
}
--------------------------------------------


[[ConfigurationContext]]
==== The Configuration Context

A +Configuration+ is basically based on a so called +ConfigurationContext+, which is
managed by the +ConfigurationProvider+. Similarly the current +ConfigurationContext+ can be accessed from the
+ConfigurationProvider+ singleton:

[source,java]
.Accessing the current +ConfigurationContext+
--------------------------------------------
ConfigurationContext context = ConfigurationProvider.getConfigurationContext();
--------------------------------------------

The +ConfigurationContext+ provides access to the internal building blocks that determine the final +Configuration+:

* +PropertySources+ registered (including the PropertySources provided from +PropertySourceProvider+ instances).
* +PropertyFilter+ registered that filter values before they are returned to the client
* +PropertyConverter+ instances that provide conversion functionality for converting String values to any other types.
* the current +PropertyValueCombinationPolicy+ that determines how property values from different PropertySources are
  combined to the final property value returned to the client.


[[Mutability]]
==== Changing the current Configuration Context

By default the +ConfigurationContext+ is not mutable once it is created. In most cases mutability is also not wanted
or at least not a needed feature. Nevertheless there are use cases where the current +ConfigurationContext+ (and
consequently +Configuration+) must be adapted:

* New configuration files where detected in a folder observed by Tamaya.
* Remote configuration, e.g. stored in a database or alternate ways has been updated and the current system must
  be adapted to these changes.
* The overall configuration context is manually setup by the application logic.
* Within unit testing alternate configuration setup should be setup to meet the configuration requirements of the
  tests executed.

In such cases the +ConfigurationContext+ must be mutable, meaning it must be possible:

* to add or remove +PropertySource+ instances
* to add or remove +PropertyFilter+ instances
* to add or remove +PropertyConverter+ instances
* to redefine the current +PropertyValueCombinationPolicy+ instances.

This can be achieved by obtaining an instance of +ConfigurationContextBuilder+. Instances of this builder can be
accessed either

* from the current +ConfigurationContext+, hereby returning a builder instance preinitialized with the values from the
  current +ConfigurationContext+
* from the current +ConfigurationProvider+ singleton.

[source,java]
.Accessing a +ConfigurationContextBuilder+
--------------------------------------------
ConfigurationContextBuilder preinitializedContextBuilder = ConfigurationProvider.getConfigurationContext().toBuilder();
ConfigurationContextBuilder emptyContextBuilder = ConfigurationProvider.getConfigurationContextBuilder();
--------------------------------------------

With such a builder a nre +ConfigurationContext+ can be created and then applied:

[source,java]
.Creating and applying a new +ConfigurationContext+
--------------------------------------------
ConfigurationContextBuilder preinitializedContextBuilder = ConfigurationProvider.getConfigurationContext().toBuilder();
ConfigurationContext context = preinitializedContextBuilder.addPropertySources(new MyPropertySource())
                                                           .addPropertyFilter(new MyFilter()).build();
ConfigurationProvider.setConfigurationContext(context);
--------------------------------------------

Hereby +ConfigurationProvider.setConfigurationContext(context)+ can throw a +UnsupportedOperationException+. if not
sure one may access the method +boolean ConfigurationProvider.isConfigurationContextSettable()+ to check if the current
+ConfigurationContext+ is mutable.


[[ConfigurationProviderSpi]]
==== Implementing and Managing Configuration

One of the most important SPI in Tamaya if the +ConfigurationProviderSpi+ interface, which is backing up the
+ConfigurationProvider+ singleton. Implementing this class allows

* to fully determine the implementation class for +Configuration+
* to manage the current +ConfigurationContext+ in the scope and granularity required.
* to provide access to the right +Configuration/ConfigurationContext+ based on the current runtime context.
* Performing changes as set with the current +ConfigurationContextBuilder+.


[[ServiceContext]]
==== The ServiceContext

The +ServiceContext+ is also a very important SPI, which allows to define how components are loaded in Tamaya.
The +ServiceContext+ hereby defines access methods to obtain components, whereas itself it is available from the
+ServiceContextManager+ singleton:

[source,java]
.Accessing the +ServiceContext+
--------------------------------------------
ServiceContext serviceContext = ServiceContextManager.getServiceContext();

public interface ServiceContext{
    int ordinal();
    <T> T getService(Class<T> serviceType);
    <T> List<T> getServices(Class<T> serviceType);
}
--------------------------------------------

With the +ServiceContext+ a component can be accessed in two different ways:

. access as as a single property. Hereby the registered instances (if multiple) are sorted by priority and then finally
  the most significant instance is returned only.
. access all items given its type. This will return (by default) all  instances loadedable from the current
  runtime context, ordered by priority, hereby the most significant components added first.


## Examples
### Accessing Configuration

_Configuration_ is obtained from the ConfigurationProvider singleton:

[source,java]
.Accessing +Configuration+
--------------------------------------------
Configuration config = ConfigurationProvider.getConfiguration();
--------------------------------------------

Many users in a SE context will probably only work with _Configuration_, since it offers all functionality
needed for basic configuration with a very lean memory and runtime footprint. In Java 7 access to the keys is
very similar to *Map<String,String>*, whereas in Java 8 additionally usage of _Optional_ is supported:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------
Configuration config = ConfigurationProvider.getConfiguration();
String myKey = config.get("myKey");                         // may return null
int myLimit = config.getInt("all.size.limit").getAsInt();   // Never returns null
--------------------------------------------

In Java 8 the following would be possible as well:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------
int myLimit = config.getOptionalInt("all.size.limit").getAsInt(); // OptionalInt
Class<T> targetClass = config.get("myClass", Class.class);        // Optional<Class>, returns  never null

### Environment and System Properties

By default environment and system properties are provided automatically as part of the default _Configuration_. The
environment properties hereby are prefixed with _env._. So we can access the current _PROMPT_ environment variable
as follows:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------
String prompt = ConfigurationProvider.getConfiguration().get("env.PROMPT");
--------------------------------------------

Similary the system properties are directly applied to the _Configuration_. So if we pass the following system
property to our JVM:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------
java ... -Duse.my.system.answer=yes
--------------------------------------------

we can access it as follows:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------
boolean useMySystem = ConfigurationProvider.getBoolean("use.my.system.answer");
--------------------------------------------


### Adding a Custom Configuration

Adding a classpath based configuration is simply as well: just implement an according _PropertySource_. With the
Tamaya core module you just have to perform the following steps:

. Define a PropertySource as follows:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------
  public class MyPropertySource extends PropertiesFilePropertySource{

    public MyPropertySource(){
        super(ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader().getResource("META-INF/cfg/myconfig.properties"));
    }
  }
--------------------------------------------

. Register the new PropertySource using the ServiceLoader by adding the following file:

[source,listing]
--------------------------------------------
META-INF/services/org.apache.tamaya.spi.PropertySource
--------------------------------------------

And adding there the entry for the new PropertySource:

[source,listing]
--------------------------------------------
comp.mapackage.MyPropertySource
--------------------------------------------
