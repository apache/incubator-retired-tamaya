== Tamaya Environment Model (Extension Module)
=== Overview

The Tamaya Environment extension adds a simple PropertySourceProvider that evaluates a List of environment context and
combines them in the given order into an (optional) root context within the system's configuration.


=== Compatibility

The module is based on Java 7, so it will not run on Java 7 and beyond.


=== Installation

To benefit from Tamaya Environment Model you only must add the corresponding dependency to your module:

[source, xml]
-----------------------------------------------
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.tamaya.ext</groupId>
  <artifactId>tamaya-envionment</artifactId>
  <version>{tamayaVersion}</version>
</dependency>
-----------------------------------------------
